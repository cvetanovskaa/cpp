/*
Musician Problem 5 (1 / 4)
Define a class Musician that has info on:

name (char array max 100)
earnings (float)
performances (int)
gender (char M/F).
Overload:

operator << for printing the name, earnings and gender (M/F)
operator > for comparing musician performance price and float.
From this class derive two new classes Guitarist and Drummer.

For the guitarist additionally we have:

guitar price (float).
For the drummer additionally we have:

age (integer).
The performance price of the musician is computed by the following rules:

for the guitarist the price per performance is GUITARPRICE10
for the drummer the price per performance is AGEâˆ—50
Each musician pays tax per earnings. Write the methods for computing taxes:

for guitarists: if the number of performances is larger than 30 the tax rate is 8% from the earnings, 10% otherwise.
for drummers: if it's man than the tax rate is 12% from the earnings, 10% otherwise.
Write a external function mostExpensiveMusician that as arguments accepts array of pointers to Musician and their number and prints the info for the musician with highest performance price.
